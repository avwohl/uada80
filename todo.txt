We recently made a PLM language compiler to z80
see ~/src/uplm80.  Do the same for the full ada
language. As minimum for testing pass ACATS.
There is a lot of good peekhole and post optimizaiton
in uplm80.  See if that can be factored out and shared
with this project.

COMPLETED:
- [x] download ada spectifications
- [x] download the ACATS test suite
- [x] do your planning for a big job thing
- [x] analyze uplm80 optimization code
- [x] design compiler architecture
- [x] plan language subset
- [x] create project structure

NEXT STEPS (Phase 1 - MVP):
- [ ] implement lexer
- [ ] implement parser (basic subset)
- [ ] define AST nodes
- [ ] implement semantic analysis
- [ ] implement simple code generator
- [ ] compile "Hello World" program
