For now, the codegen infrastructure is in place. The MemoryLocation has is_atomic and
  is_volatile flags, and codegen will emit DI/EI when those are set. The full integration with
  lowering would require updating all the places where MemoryLocations are created to check the
   symbol flags - this is a larger refactoring task.

We recently made a PLM language compiler to z80
see ~/src/uplm80.  Do the same for the full ada
language. As minimum for testing pass ACATS.
There is a lot of good peekhole and post optimizaiton
in uplm80.  See if that can be factored out and shared
with this project.

COMPLETED:
- [x] download ada spectifications
- [x] download the ACATS test suite
- [x] do your planning for a big job thing
- [x] analyze uplm80 optimization code
- [x] design compiler architecture
- [x] plan language subset
- [x] create project structure

NEXT STEPS (Phase 1 - MVP):
- [ ] implement lexer
- [ ] implement parser (basic subset)
- [ ] define AST nodes
- [ ] implement semantic analysis
- [ ] implement simple code generator
- [ ] compile "Hello World" program

CPMEMU INTERRUPT SUPPORT (v1.5.0):
The emulator now supports scheduled interrupts for testing interrupt-driven code:

  # Maskable interrupt (respects DI/EI) every 4000-4500 cycles, RST 7
  cpmemu --mask-interrupt 4000-4500 rst 7 program.com

  # Maskable interrupt calling specific address
  cpmemu --mask-interrupt 5000-6000 call 0x0100 program.com

  # NMI (cannot be disabled) every 10000-12000 cycles, jumps to 0x0066
  cpmemu --nmi 10000-12000 program.com

Random range helps expose race conditions. For Ada tasking:
- Timer interrupt at RST 7 (0x0038) for task scheduler tick
- DI/EI brackets around critical sections
- RETI to return and re-enable interrupts
- NMI available for urgent/unblockable handlers
